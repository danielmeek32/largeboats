Minetest mod: largeboats
========================
Large boats that can carry two players. Craft from two regular boats.

The first player to get in sits at the back and controls the boat. The front
player can control the boat if the rear player gets out, until another rear
player gets in.

Modified from the boats mod in Minetest Game.
